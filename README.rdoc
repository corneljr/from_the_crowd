== From The Crowd

This is a project hurley87 and I are working on as a side project while at Bitmaker Labs. It is essentially a blogging platform for amateur sports writers. We plan to provide the writers with a wide range of metrics about how other users have recieved their articles and how large of a following they have. Similar to how github provides this information regarding codebases.

We will be hopefully releasing a beta near the end of July to a collection of writers for testing and validation purposes.
